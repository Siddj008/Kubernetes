# Kubernetes
This repository serves as a centralized resource for Kubernetes, containing all essential commands, configurations, and related materials. It is designed to support efficient management, learning, and implementation of Kubernetes concepts and practices

Kubernetes Overview
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Why Kubernetes?
* Container Orchestration: Kubernetes helps manage multiple containers across clusters of machines, ensuring that applications run reliably and efficiently.
* Scaling and Self-healing: Kubernetes automatically scales applications based on demand and replaces failed containers to maintain uptime.
* Simplified Networking: It handles internal communication between containers and manages load balancing.
Key Kubernetes Concepts



* Pod: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single container or a group of containers that share the same network and storage.
* Node: A machine (virtual or physical) that runs one or more Pods. It contains the necessary components to run and manage containers.
* Deployment: A higher-level abstraction that manages the lifecycle of Pods, including scaling and updating them.
Service: A stable endpoint for accessing a group of Pods, providing features like load balancing and service discovery.
* Ingress: Manages external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS traffic, enabling routing and SSL termination.
* Volume: Provides persistent storage that can be shared across Pods.
* ConfigMap and Secret: Store configuration data and sensitive information like passwords.
Kubernetes Architecture
* Control Plane: Manages the cluster, including the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.
* Node Components: Each node runs a Kubelet (manages containers) and Kube Proxy (handles networking).
  
Benefits of Kubernetes
* Portability: Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, ensuring consistent application behavior across various environments.
* Resilience: Automatically recovers from failures and ensures high availability of applications.
* Efficient Resource Utilization: Efficiently manages resources by running multiple containers on the same node and allocating resources dynamically.
* CI/CD Enablement: Kubernetes integrates well with CI/CD pipelines for faster deployment cycles.
Use Cases
* Running microservices-based applications.
* Managing large-scale containerized applications.
* Ensuring high availability and disaster recovery for applications.
